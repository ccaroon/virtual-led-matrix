# Pixel Matrix // Examples

* [random-dots-1.py](./random-dots-1.py)
    - Code that uses the `PixelMatrix` class directly (defnining it's own event loop) to draw random colored dots on the screen.
    - Demonstrates using the `PixelMatrix` class directly.
* [random-dots-2.py](./random-dots-2.py)
    - A Pixel Matrix Program, defined as a single function and executed with the `Program.exec_func` class method, that draws random colored dots on the screen.
    - Demonstrates using the `Program.exec_func` method to run a simple program.
* [random-dots-3.py](./random-dots-3.py)
    - A Pixel Matrix Program, defined as a sub-class of `Program`, that draws random colored lines on the screen.
    - Demonstrates using a sub-class of the `Program` class for more complex programs.
* [pixel-walker.py](./pixel-walker.py)
    - A Pixel Matrix Program that "walks" across the Pixel Matrix, lighting (drawing) each pixel in turn.
    - Useful for testing different pixel colors, shapes, sizes and spacing.
